Mental health is a critical issue, and social media platforms like Reddit have become spaces where many people share their experiences, struggles, and seek support. However, manually identifying posts related to mental health can be overwhelming, given the massive amount of content generated daily. This project seeks to address that challenge by using machine learning to automatically classify Reddit posts into mental health-related discussions and non-mental health topics. Additionally, the project aims to identify and categorize specific mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and PTSD, from these posts. The ultimate goal is to build a system that can effectively pinpoint mental health-related conversations and potentially help identify individuals who might need support.

The dataset for this project comes from a collection of Reddit posts spanning several subreddits dedicated to both mental health and non-mental health topics. It includes posts from mental health-focused communities like r/depression, r/anxiety, r/suicidewatch, and others that cover issues such as ADHD, PTSD, and addiction. In addition, there are broader mental health subreddits like r/mentalhealth and r/COVID19_support, which discuss more general mental health topics. On the other side, there are non-mental health subreddits such as r/fitness, r/legaladvice, and r/parenting, which are unrelated to mental health but help provide a contrasting set of data to train the machine learning model. 

The dataset itself is quite large, containing over 198 million words spread across 12.7 million sentences. After filtering out common stopwords (such as "the," "and," or "is"), we are left with approximately 77 million meaningful words. While the dataset is imbalanced, with more posts related to non-mental health topics than mental health discussions, it still provides sufficient data on various mental health issues to train an effective model. The challenge here is to use machine learning techniques to identify which posts relate to mental health and then further classify them into specific categories, such as depression, anxiety, or addiction.

To achieve this, the project employs several techniques. First, we use **CountVectorizer** and **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**, which help convert the text into numerical data that a machine learning model can process. TF-IDF, in particular, adjusts the frequency of words based on how rare or important they are across the entire dataset, ensuring the model focuses on the most meaningful terms. Additionally, we fine-tune a pre-trained **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** model. BERT is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model that understands the context of words in sentences, making it especially useful for understanding the nuances in mental health-related discussions.

In terms of data preprocessing, we use **spaCy** to clean and tokenize the data, and then store the tokenized data in an efficient format using **Pandas** and **PyArrow**. The entire process is designed to help the model learn from the text data, so it can accurately classify posts and recognize different mental health issues.

The ultimate aim of this project is to develop a system that can help identify and categorize mental health discussions on social media platforms, which could be used to provide more timely interventions or support to individuals in need.
